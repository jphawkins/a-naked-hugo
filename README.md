# A Naked Hugo Template
*built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)* by - [KristopherRay.com](https://kristopherray.com)  

### You can see an demo running [here](https://anakedhugo.netlify.app/)

This "template" *(I hate that word)* follows best-practices and preferences for my Hugo / Netlify workflow. It is a clean and lean foundation for all my new projects that leverages the familiar Bootstrap 5.1.3 grid framework and some misc. helpers, but stripped of the features I never use. Everything else is "naked" and ready for a custom development, the way the web should be <3

*Packaged with:*
- [All the original <3 Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) [5.1.3]
- [Magnific Popup](https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/)
- [Animate on Scroll (AOS)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- [NetlifyCMS](https://netlifycms.org)

**Deployment Ready for Netlify**

**Required Local Dependancies:**
- [ >= Hugo v0.108.0 - Extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/)

**Optional Dependancies:**
- [SASS (node-sass)](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)

#### **To Run A Local Server With Hugo (with Hugo[extended] Installed Locally):**  

1. Open Command Line / BASH and run
`hugo serve`

2. Navigate your browser to 
`localhost:1313` (or whatever is displayed in the command prompt)
